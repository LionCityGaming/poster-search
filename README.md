## Prerequisites

- A working [DAPS](https://github.com/Drazzilb08/daps) installation
- Access to the DAPS posters directory
- Bash shell (version 4.0 or higher)
- Terminal with basic color support (enhanced features available for terminals with advanced color support)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LionCityGaming/poster-search.git
cd poster-search
```

2. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x poster-search.sh
```

3. Set up configuration (optional but recommended):
```bash
# First run creates the example configuration
./poster-search.sh -h

# Copy and customize the configuration
cp poster-search.env.example poster-search.env
nano poster-search.env  # Edit paths and users as needed
```

## Configuration

The script supports both internal configuration and external configuration files for enhanced portability:

### External Configuration (Recommended)
Create a `poster-search.env` file in the same directory as the script:

```bash
# Poster directory paths (comma-separated)
POSTER_PATHS="/etc/komodo/stacks/daps-ui/daps-ui/posters,/path/to/additional/posters"

# User configuration (comma-separated user:color pairs)
USERS_CONFIG="LionCityGaming:1;31,IamSpartacus:1;32,Drazzilb:1;34"
```

### Setup Instructions:
1. **First run**: The script automatically creates `poster-search.env.example` 
2. **Copy and customize**: `cp poster-search.env.example poster-search.env`
3. **Modify paths**: Update `POSTER_PATHS` with your poster directories
4. **Customize users**: Update `USERS_CONFIG` with your users and preferred colors
5. **Update-safe**: Your configuration persists across script updates

### Internal Configuration (Fallback)
If no `poster-search.env` file exists, the script uses built-in defaults:

```bash
# Search paths - Add or modify paths as needed
declare -a SEARCH_PATHS=(
    "/etc/komodo/stacks/daps-ui/daps-ui/posters"    # Main DAPS posters directory
)

# User priority and color mapping with fallback support
declare -a USERS=(
    "LionCityGaming:1;31"         # Light Red
    "IamSpartacus:1;32"           # Light Green
    # Format: "username:color_code"
)
```

The color system automatically detects your terminal's capabilities and provides:
- Advanced colors for modern terminals
- Basic colors for standard terminals
- Fallback to no colors for limited terminals

## Terminal Compatibility

The script now includes smart terminal detection and will automatically:
1. Use advanced colors (including light/dark variations) on fully-capable terminals
2. Fall back to basic ANSI colors on terminals with standard color support
3. Disable colors completely on terminals without color support

This ensures optimal visibility and compatibility across different terminal emulators and SSH sessions.

## Collection Management

The enhanced file count and disk usage feature provides valuable insights for collection management:

- **Quick overview**: See which users contribute the most content and use the most disk space
- **Format analysis**: Identify format distribution and storage usage across your collection
- **Storage planning**: Understand collection size for backup and storage decisions with precise disk usage information
- **User activity**: Monitor active contributors to your poster collection and their storage impact
- **Performance analysis**: Identify users with the largest collections for optimization
- **Storage optimization**: Find users with high file counts but low disk usage (smaller files) or vice versa

### Advanced Collection Analysis Examples:
```bash
# Find users with the most content
./poster-search.sh -c -s count-desc

# Find users using the most disk space
./poster-search.sh -c -s size-desc

# Analyze PNG distribution and disk usage
./poster-search.sh -c -f png -s size-desc

# Get alphabetical user overview with disk usage
./poster-search.sh -c -s username

# Find users with minimal collections
./poster-search.sh -c -s count-asc

# Find users with smallest disk footprint
./poster-search.sh -c -s size-asc
```

### Recommended Usage Patterns:
- `./poster-search.sh -i` - **Start enhanced interactive mode for best user experience**
- `./poster-search.sh -c` - Get overall collection statistics with disk usage
- `./poster-search.sh -c -f jpg -s size-desc` - See top JPG contributors by disk usage
- `./poster-search.sh -c -s count-asc` - Identify users who might need more content
- `./poster-search.sh -c -s size-desc` - Identify users consuming the most storage space
- `./poster-search.sh -c -f png -s count-desc` - Find users with the most PNG files

## Performance

The script has been optimized for performance when calculating disk usage:
- Uses `find -printf` for efficient file size collection
- Single-pass directory traversal for both counting and size calculation
- Handles large collections (50,000+ files) efficiently
- Supports collections ranging from GB to TB in size
- **Enhanced interactive mode performance with faster menu transitions**

## Directory Structure

The script is designed to work with DAPS directory structure and expects images to be organized in the following way:
```
/etc/komodo/stacks/daps-ui/daps-ui/posters/  # Default DAPS posters directory
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user1/                                   # DAPS sync username
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image1.jpg
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ image2.png
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user2/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image3.jpg
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ image4.png
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user3/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ image5.jpg
```

**Configuration Options:**
- **Built-in default**: `/etc/komodo/stacks/daps-ui/daps-ui/posters`
- **External config**: Define custom paths in `poster-search.env`
- **Multiple paths**: Support for searching across multiple poster directories
- **Automatic detection**: Script creates example config on first run
